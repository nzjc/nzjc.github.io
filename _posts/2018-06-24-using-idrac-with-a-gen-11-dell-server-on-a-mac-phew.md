This post is really a persistent note for me. Every now and then I end up going down the road where I need to administer a Dell server (typically one I can afford for home use, like a Dell R610) &#8211; only to find that everything I rely on at work (like having windows/java/etc) is out the door. Here are some steps to allow access to the iDRAC on Dell Rx10 server from a Mac, using Chrome as a browser.

1: Install Java SRE &#8211;Â https://java.com/en/download/mac_download.jsp

2: Log into the web front-end of your iDRAC (mine is at 192.168.0.195 for future reference)

3: Go to the Console/Media tab and select &#8216;Configuration&#8217;

4: Change the plugin type from Native to Java, and disable video encryption.

5: Open System Preferences on your Mac, and find Java. Go to the &#8216;Security&#8217; tab and add the https address of your iDRAC to the list of excepted sites.

6: You need to edit this file

<pre class=""><code>/Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents/Home/lib/security/java.security</code></pre>

And comment out the line that starts with &#8220;**jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms&#8221;**

7: Back in the iDRAC web front-end, you can click &#8216;Launch&#8217; on virtual console. This will download a .jnlp file (or a hideously renamed one, in my case). Rename this file viewer.jnlp (and accept OSX complaining about changing file extension).

8: Edit viewer.jnlp with a text editor (TextEdit or Nano will do) &#8211; and replace the &#8216;user&#8217; and &#8216;passwd&#8217; fields (which will be hashed numbers/text) with your iDRAC login details. Note &#8211; this step is optional, but it means you can open the console without having to log into iDRAC every time.

Should be good to go!
