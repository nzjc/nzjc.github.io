Hoo boy. I have been trying to configure a small mesh network for a fault-resilient office setup. In my network, I have a 'square' setup, two VMX routers, two Fortigate virtual firewall appliances, all running on top of ESXi 6.5 (two physical hypervisors). It looks like this:

Anyway. In order to redistribute the default route(s) received from the upstreams, I wanted to use iBGP inside the 'square' of devices.. iBGP relies on an IGP, so I chose the coolest one available, ISIS.

This is a very simple setup, but there was no way I could get an adjacency to form between the router and firewall (green to black in the diagram). I tried 100 things (changing hello intervals ([pointless](http://packetlife.net/blog/2008/may/14/hello-timer-behaviors/)!), LSP generation times, MTU, MTU, MTU and several other desperate things like disabling hello-padding, enabling and disabling 'adjacency checking' on the Forti-devices).. Nothing.

Eventually, I enabled trace-options on the Junos side of things - I could see my adjacencies with the Forti-devices stuck in the 'Initializing' phase, implying the three-way-handshake was busted.. The traceoptions showed some guff, but nothing that pointed to an easily solvable problem (i.e. not MTU)..

Finally, using the debug features of the Fortigate box, I found:

<pre class="lang:default decode:true">id=20301 logdesc="Routing log" msg="IS-IS: PDU[RECV]: P2P-Hello IS-

Neighbor(port2-0192.1681.0020) IPv6 protocols supported mismatch</pre>

Bearing in mind, there isn't a single bit of IPv6 config on any of these devices (yet, it's going to be fully dual stack, don't worry!) - so what was up.. Turns out, the Fortigate devices were a bit sensitive, and needed the following knob in my Juniper ISIS config:

<pre class="lang:default decode:true ">james@vmx-2&gt; show configuration protocols isis | display set
set protocols isis no-ipv6-routing
</pre>

All of a sudden.. My ISIS adjacencies are up and solid.

Hopefully this will be useful to some sucker in future who chooses to use ISIS in their corporate network ðŸ™‚
