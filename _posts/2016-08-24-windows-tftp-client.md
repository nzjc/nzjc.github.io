This is mostly a note to self.

3CDaemon was always my Windows TFTP server of choice, but finding a valid .exe that works on Windows 7 64bit and isn't riddled with viruses is a problem when you're in a hurry. Ph Jounin has written the lovely Tftpd64. You can get it from the main site [here](http://tftpd32.jounin.net/tftpd32_download.html) (and in 32bit flavours if you like). I'll upload the zip here too, incase it ever goes offline.

I don't mind if you never want to trust a download from a random blog, but for my own stress levels, now I have it in the cloud ðŸ™‚
