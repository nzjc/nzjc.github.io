When playing with an Openstack POC recently, I nearly pulled my hair out. I am running a flat provider network between my compute nodes (all Ubuntu 16.04), which connect via Â Cisco 2900 with an inbuilt switch module. The Cisco has gateway addresses for the dual-stack host networks. I was using native IPv6 and NAT&#8217;d private space for IPv4.

Whenever I went to launch an instance, DHCP would work (SLAAC for v6), and the Horizon front-end would show the generated addresses assigned to the instance. Looks good. Going into the console of the instance, I&#8217;d see (with ifconfig) no IP addresses on my host NIC.. Looking in the &#8220;neutron-dhcp-agent.log&#8221; log, I would see:

2017-03-24 23:49:44.169 2476 WARNING stevedore.named [req-6710e8a6-5991-446e-b8d2-5af6c9d27625 &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; -] Could not load neutron.agent.linux.interface.BridgeInterfaceDriver

Whenever an instance was on. Cycling over and over for the number of instances. When I looked at the bridge status (in my topology the eno4 phyical interface of the compute/controller nodes are connected to the physical provider network), I would not see eno4 in the bridge created to connect hosts to physical. The way Openstack Neutron does this is to build a bridge, then add the physical and TAP interfaces). Mine was missing. Why&#8230;

Turns out &#8211; I had an IPv6 DHCP scope on my Cisco provider network interface facing the Openstack environment. As soon as I removed this piece of config (and simply left the IPv4 and IPv6 gateways on that interface) &#8211; eno4 showed up in the bridge and it all went smoothly.

What a mission.
